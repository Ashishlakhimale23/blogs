# Redux toolkit

why to use state management libraries ?

when to use state management libraries ?

how to use the state management library (redux toolkit) ?

when to use useState and when to use useReducer

       use useState when the operations on the state  are not in multiple no

       use useReducer when the operation on the state are in multiple no so the upadtion logic can be 

       separated from the actual ui component to avoid the messiness of the code 

## Take aways

context is not a state management tool its a dependency injection ([https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/mqblj2/redux_vs_usecontext_usereducer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/mqblj2/redux_vs_usecontext_usereducer/))

In [software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), **dependency injection** is a programming technique in which an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) or [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) receives other objects or functions that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally. Dependency injection aims to [separate the concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) of constructing objects and using them, leading to [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) programs.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#cite_note-MarkSeeman2011P4-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection#cite_note-3) The pattern ensures that an object or function that wants to use a given [service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(systems_architecture)) should not have to know how to construct those services.

**Why React Context is Not a "State Management" Tool (and Why It Doesn't Replace Redux)**

([https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/#are-context-and-redux-the-same-thing](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/#are-context-and-redux-the-same-thing))

context is just a pipeline like architecture to just pass down the data not actually managing it .

# redux toolkit

1. create a store using store configuration 
2. create reducers using createslice
- create initial state
- add reducers

  3.  use the state using useSelector and use reducers using useDispatch
